    "🏗️ The Synthetic Data Structure (SCM)The data is organized into three main types of features, plus the target variable. They are interconnected to simulate a realistic scenario, like our loan approval task.1. The Target Outcome: $Y$Definition: $Y$ is the dependent variable that your Logistic Regression model tries to predict.Analogy: In the loan project, $Y$ is the Loan Approval Decision (1 for approved, 0 for denied).How it's Determined: $Y$ is primarily a function of the Predictive Features ($R$), the Sensitive Feature ($Q$) (if bias is introduced), and some Noise ($\\epsilon_y$ or $sy$).$$\\mathbf{Y} = f(\\mathbf{R}, \\mathbf{Q}) + \\epsilon_y$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Sensitive Feature: $Q$ Definition: $Q$ is the protected attribute that you use to test for fairness disparities.Analogy: In the loan project, $Q$ is the Group ID (e.g., Group A or Group B), which is binary.Relation to $Y$ (Bias):In the unbiased baseline ($D_{base}$), the parameter l_q is set to $0$, meaning $Q$ has no direct influence on $Y$.To introduce bias (H1), you increase the l_q value, creating an unfair causal link between $Q$ and $Y$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Predictive Features: $R$ Definition: $R$ represents the set of features that should legitimately determine the outcome $Y$. These are the non-sensitive features.Analogy: In the loan project, $R$ includes features like Credit Score and Annual Income.Relation to $Y$ (Signal):$R$ has the strongest legitimate causal influence on $Y$. The model is expected to learn this relationship.The parameter l_y (historical bias on $Y$) often determines the baseline strength of the signal from $R$ to $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Other Variables$A$: This is often used interchangeably with the Sensitive Feature $Q$ in bias literature (for \"Protected Attribute\"). The p_u (undersampling) parameter uses $A=1$ to denote the group being undersampled.$\\epsilon$ (Epsilon): Represents various forms of random noise.$\\epsilon_y$ is the noise added to the target $Y$, controlled by the sy parameter.$\\epsilon_R$ and $\\epsilon_Q$ represent noise/randomness in the features themselves, which are generated in the background."

    "Key Assumption: We assume $Q$ represents our Sensitive Feature (e.g., Group A/B) and $R$ represents the Predictive Features (e.g., Credit Score, Income). The setting $l\\_q=0.0$ ensures that the sensitive feature $Q$ has no direct causal influence on the outcome $Y$, making the baseline data inherently fair."
